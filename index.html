    <ol>
      <li class="highlight ">

        and/or a failing the course with an academic integrity violation. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Late Work Policy </h2>
    <p>
      Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date.
      If you must miss class or a due date, contact the instructor in advance or as early as possible.
      Due dates get you ready for coming material. Keeping up is critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      On rare occassions, special challenges or obligations may make it difficult to submit on time.
      You typically have a one-week grace period where the work may still be submitted and graded.

    You may be asked to explain your work during class,
    in discussions, or in a recorded submission.

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    Grades will generally be posted within 2-7 days of the due date.
    If you wish to petition for additional points, please wait 24 hours.
    Petitions must be emailed, and must include the specific changes you are requesting,
    along with your reasoning on why the higher score is warranted.
    Challenges must be raised within seven days of the grade being posted;
    after seven days, grades are considered final.

    <h2>Save Your Content</h2>
    The course site will not be available after the end of the semester.
    Save the syllabus and any materials you wish to access after the course,
    you may need to submit this to a potential employer or another university in the future.
    We do not provide materials after completion of the course.

    <!-- Standard University -->

    <h2> Grade of Incomplete (I)</h2>
    Following Northwest Missouri State University policy, incomplete grades may only be given in extreme circumstances,
    such as illness, death in a student 's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's control, and
    the student was unable to complete a significant portion of the course work.

    <h2>Attendance </h2>
    Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course syllabi for each course. This course has
    many in-class activities, most of which have points and may not be announced in advance. Students arriving late or
    missing activities due to unexcused absences may not be able to make up certain types of work and may earn zero
    points for the
    activity. Notify your instructor when unable to attend class. Please refer to the university policy on attendance
    at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf">https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf</a>

    <h2>Excused Absences </h2>
    Excused absences include attendance at a university sponsored event (documented with an excuse signed by the
    university sponsor prior to the event) or by circumstances considered extenuating by the course instructor. A
    student may make up class work without penalty for excused absences.

    <h2>Final Exams</h2>
    If an emergency occurs that prevents the administration of a course scheduled final examination, the final course
    grades will be calculated based on the work in the course completed to that point in time and the faculty member’s
    considered judgment. Final exams will not be rescheduled, and a grade of “I” will not be given as a result of an
    institutional cancellation of a final examination.

    <h2>Administrative Drop </h2>
    An instructor may request the Office of the Registrar delete a student from a course roster if the student has not
    met the prerequisite for the course as stated in the catalog, or as a result of non-attendance in the course.

    <h2>Course Access</h2>
    Course content is provided via Canvas and Northwest Online. Access to Northwest Online is at
